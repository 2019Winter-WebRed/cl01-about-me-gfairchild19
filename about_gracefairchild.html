    <h1>All About Grace Fairchild</h1> 
        <hr/>
<P>I am 17 years old and a senior in high school. My birthday is March 30, 2001. I was born in Brosward, Florida and moved to Atlanta, Georgia when I was 6. I lived in Georgia for about 8 years and then I moved to Pennsylvania. Last year, my family moved back to Georgia but I stayed here to finish my senior year. I currently live with one of my friends. I've known her and her family for about 4 years now and they have become my second family. I go home pretty often, either on holidays or longer weekends.</P>
        
<P>I have 2 brothers. My older brother's name is Jake and he is 20 years old. He is a sophomore at Florida State University. My younger brother's name is Josh, he is 14 and in the 8th grade. I also have 2 dogs, a boxer named Stella and a bulldog named Harvey. My parents are named Julie and Dewayne. I am really close with my aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins. Every year we go to Hilton Head Island together and always have a really fun time. All together their is about 17 of us.</P>

<P>I currently work at Panera Bread on Kirkwood Highway. I am a cashier and usually work about 3-4 shifts a week. I really enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with my friends, and being creative with filming and editing. I am planning on going to the <b>University of South Florida </b> next year. I really love going to the beach, listening to music, and going to concerts/music festivals. I enjoy all kinds of music including rap, country, pop, and many other genres. My favorite movie is <i>The Last Song</i> with Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth.<P/> My favorite quote is <blockquote> "Everything happens for a reason."</blockquote>
